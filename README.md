# Classification_With_Quantum_Neural_Network_Classifier
Quantum Neural Network Classifier
NeuralNetworkClassifier 

In this tutorial we show how the NeuralNetworkClassifier and NeuralNetworkRegressor are used. Both take as an input a (Quantum) NeuralNetwork and leverage it in a specific context. In both cases we also provide a pre-configured variant for convenience, the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) and Variational Quantum Regressor (VQR). The tutorial is structured as follows:
